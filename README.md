# SQL Projects

Welcome to my SQL Projects portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects where I have utilized SQL to analyze and generate insights from data. Each project represents a unique data analysis scenario and demonstrates my skills in leveraging SQL capabilities to derive valuable insights.

## Projects

In this repository, you will find various SQL projects for unique data analysis scenario. Each project is contained within its own directory and includes a README file with instructions and requirements.

Here are some examples of the projects you can find in this repository:

- [CODEX Challenge](Codex_Challenge/Codex_Challenge_Solutions.sql): CodeX is a German beverage company that is aiming to make its mark in the Indian market. They conducted a survey in those 10 cities and received results from 10k respondents. Peter Pandey, a marketing data analyst is tasked to convert these survey results to meaningful insights which the team can use to drive actions.
